# LatentSync_Automatic

Original repe : https://github.com/bytedance/LatentSync

For setup, refer to original repo.

I modified it so that lip-syncing conversion and voice merge can be done at the same time with one cli command.

```
python mergeprocess.py   --video assets/<your_video>.mp4   --audio assets/<your_audio>.wav   --out <output_path>.mp4
```

Tested on LatentSync1.5
